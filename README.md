## Hey, I’m Sean 

I’m a Computer Science graduate from the University of Florida with experience working across software engineering and technology roles in enterprise environments.

I enjoy building full stack systems that feel solid in real use. I like working on internal tools, automation, and dashboards that help teams move faster and make better decisions. Through internships at Wells Fargo, American Airlines, and UKG, I’ve worked on projects where reliability, security, and collaboration actually mattered.

Outside of code, I value leadership, communication, and community. Serving as president of UF NSBE and participating in programs like MLT Career Prep and the Bloomberg Engineering Tech Lab shaped how I approach problems and work with people.

### A few things I’ve built
• **Fade Finder**  
  An AI powered haircut recommendation tool inspired by my experience as a barber. Users upload a photo and receive haircut style suggestions along with explanations based on face shape, hair texture, and reference styles. The goal is to make barber consultations faster, clearer, and more accessible while keeping the human decision in the loop.

• **Platform Integration Insights**  
  Internal onboarding and observability tooling supporting over 1,000 enterprise applications  

• **Discord Job Listings Bot**  
  An automated system that pulls live job and internship postings and delivers them to a Discord community of over 100 students  

• **Clips for a Cause**  
  A full stack donation platform built with Next.js and AWS to support community driven fundraising  

• **Friendly Neighborhood Guardians**  
  A C++ backend project comparing hash tables and B plus trees for fast lookup across large datasets
